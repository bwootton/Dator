# Dator - Data Aggregation for Robots
Data aggregation and control program selection for groups of robots

Dator is a lightweight data aggregation platform for groups of robots.  It's built to address the following needs:

* Aggregation of data from multiple robots to a central platform.
* HTTP(S) command polling and data push from robots on private networks to a centralized platform, avoiding the need to bridge into the local robot's network to control and anlyze data.
* RESTful access of aggregated data for simple data anlaysis and command generation by remote systems.
* **Optionally:** Easy iteration of program update, deploy and test to a group of robots.
